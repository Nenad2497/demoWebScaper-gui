# demoWebScaper-gui
This is the small GUI idea of web scraper that will search only one item by providing target url , HTML element, and CSS class. Data will be displayed on tree view under input fields. We have choices to save that data as a .txt file or .json file and choice to clean tree view and start again if we need more or we didn't find the result we wanted.
